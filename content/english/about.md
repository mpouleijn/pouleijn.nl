My unstoppable __positive energy__ is one of my **strongest** skills. It stimulates me to **innovate** and get the best out of myself and others. In the past 15+ years, I have led many different teams and we have achieved things that I could never imagine where **possible!** Seeing a person / team **grow** above themselves and doing things they never thought they would be able to do gives me all the energy I need to continue. Project **success** is my primary goal in any project and my tool belt with great business tools to help with that.

In my spare time I am interested in technology, electronics, IoT, machine learning, running and most importantly my wife and 3 daughters.
